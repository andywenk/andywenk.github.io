As you may know, I am very involved in the [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) project. I really like contributing because the community is cool and CouchDB is an awesome piece of software.

Recently the invitation to become an *Apache Software Foundation Member* dropped into my mailbox. Wow! I am relly honoured and I accepted the invitation. Thanks a lot to [Noah Slater](https://twitter.com/nslater) who suggested me and started the election.

The ASF
-------

So what is a member? To be honnest, I did not know when I became a Apache CouchDB committer last November. The ASF has a quite simple structure:

###Users

Everyone who is using ASF software

###Contributors

People who are contributing to a project by sending code patches, writing blog posts or articles. They do not have further rights to commit code for example.

###Committers

When someone is contributing a lot, he will eventually be invited to become a committer and will be granted access rights to infrastructure used. We call that simply *commit bits*.

###PMC member

Each project has a Project Management Committee. Committers will be asked to join the PMC when they continuously committ to the project and help to organise the project affairs.

###Project Chair

Every project has a **chair**. The chair will automatically become a member because he should be able to state his opinion in the ASF affairs.

###ASF member

The ASF members are helping to control the ASF affairs. So members are not bound to a specific project but are an global instance. Mostly, they contribute to more projects.

###ASF board

The board is overseeing the ASF activities and is elected by the members annually.

This is just a simple summary of the ASF structure. There also many processes and bylaws. If interested, you can find a lot of information at the [ASF website](http://apache.org/). Or - simply ask me :)

I am really looking forward to contribute to the ASF. I think the ASF is a great place for Open Source Software and I encourage you to check out the website. I am sure you are already using ASF software. Did you know, that 60% of the websites you are surfing on are run with a [Apache Webserver](http://httpd.apache.org/) and that the [Open Source Office Software](https://www.openoffice.org/) you are likely using is also an ASF project?
