<p>Moin Moin,</p>

<p>a former customer and now friend of mine, <a href="http://birgerking.net/" target="_blank">Birger Hartung</a>, was creating some absolute amazing sketches concerning &#8220;social media&#8221;. He&#8217;s calling himself a internet visionary and his philosophy about the internet is 5 years ahead. Check it out by yourself - I like his thoughts a lot. Even when I do not fully agree all the time &#8230; </p>

<p>Have fun and tell me what you think about &#8230;</p>

<p>Andy</p>
