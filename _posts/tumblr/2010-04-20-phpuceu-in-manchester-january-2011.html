<p>Moin Moin,</p>

<p>last evening, the organizers of the <a href="http://www.phpuceu.org/" target="_blank">PHPucEU</a> had another Skype session. The most important result is the fact, that we decided to let PHPucEU take place in Manchester next year. At the moment, the weekend of 29th to 30th January is our working date. We know spread this date and hope to get a lot of feedback if that date will fit for most people.</p>

<p>See the blog post about yesterday&#8217;s meeting at the <a href="http://www.phpuceu.org/2010/04/19/looking-for-the-right-date/" target="_blank">official PHPucEU blog</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Andy</p>
