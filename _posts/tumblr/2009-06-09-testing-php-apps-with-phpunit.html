Moin Moin,

<p>
I am a bad programmer! This is the conclusion after reading the first lines of <a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/" target="_blank">Sebastian Bergmanns</a> <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.4/en/index.html" target="_blank">manual for PHPUnit</a>.
</p>
<p>
<em>"Even good programmers make mistakes. The difference between a good programmer and a bad programmer is that the good programmer uses tests to detect his mistakes as soon as possible. The sooner you test for a mistake the greater your chance of finding it and the less it will cost to find and fix."</em>
</p>
<p>
Ok - I will take my first words not too serious but I have to admit, that I do not develop test driven. The reason for that is the fact, that I never had an idea how to do it. I bought Sebastian Bergmanns <a href="http://www.amazon.de/PHPUnit-kurz-gut-Sebastian-Bergmann/dp/3897215152/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1244538197&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank">"quick and dirty" PHPUnit</a> book some years ago but did not tune in to it any further. Another reason ist the fact, that <a href="http://www.e-unique.com" target="_blank">eUNIQUE</a> for example was started without any testing. Drilling tests afterwards into was expected too expensive.
</p>
<p>
Since I have an account at <a href="http://github.com/andywenk" target="_blank">github</a> and are following some folks programming in Python or Ruby I recognized, that no software is going over the wire without tests. Which is a good thing in my opinion. Realizing that we have some really stupid bugs in our software (and also in other projects of mine) opened the disussion about using tests again - at least in my mind. But mentioning, using tests would definitely be a good idea was thrown to ground with the answer: there&#8217;s no time to do that. I don&#8217;t believe in that. I think the opposite is the truth. Thanks to a tweet from Stefan Bergmann, that the PHPUnit Manual has a new CSS style, I started to read it. I will drop my experiences here in the next few posts because now I will start using tests!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Installing PHPUnit</strong>
</p>
<p>
You know that I am using an <a href="http://www.debian.org" target="_blank">Debian based system</a>. So sorry to all the other geeks out there when I just explain stuff based on this OS. It shouldn&#8217;t be a big thing to adapt this to other OS.
</p>
<p>
PHPUnit is delivered by <a href="http://pear.php.net/" target="_blank">PEAR</a>. I was running in a small issue when trying to install PHPUnit like explained in the manual. The reason was the wrong PEAR Installer. Fix it like this:
</p>
<p>
If you never used PEAR or it might be old, simply reinstall it (just to be save):
</p>

<pre>$ sudo aptitude reinstall php-pear</pre>

Next step is to add the channel for PHPUnit
<pre>$ sudo pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
Adding Channel "pear.phpunit.de" succeeded
Discovery of channel "pear.phpunit.de" succeeded</pre>

Good - now we try to install PHPUnit (output shortened):

<pre>$ sudo pear install phpunit/PHPUnit
...
phpunit/PHPUnit requires PEAR Installer (version &gt;= 1.8.1), installed version is 1.7.1
...
No valid packages found
install failed</pre>
<p>
Ok - this did not work. So we have to update the PEAR installer. Checking out the PEAR page helps. Follow these steps (shortened):
</p>
<pre>$ sudo pear upgrade --force <a href="http://pear.php.net/get/PEAR-1.4.3.tar" target="_blank">http://pear.php.net/get/PEAR-1.4.3.tar</a>
downloading PEAR-1.4.3.tar ...
Starting to download PEAR-1.4.3.tar (Unknown size)
.............done: 1,745,408 bytes
WARNING: channel "pear.php.net" has updated its protocols, use "channel-update pear.php.net" to update

...done: 18,119 bytes

...
</pre>
Ok - now we follow the instructions of upgrading the protocol:

<pre>$ sudo pear channel-update pear.php.net
Retrieving channel.xml from remote server
Update of Channel "pear.php.net" succeeded</pre>

Then we upgrade PEAR (output shortened):
<pre>
$ sudo pear upgrade PEAR
downloading PEAR-1.8.1.tgz ...

........................................done: 290,382 bytes

...done: 17,729 bytes
upgrade ok: channel://pear.php.net/XML_Util-1.2.1
upgrade ok: channel://pear.php.net/PEAR-1.8.1</pre>

And finally we install PHPUnit (shortened):

<pre>$ sudo pear install phpunit/PHPUnit
downloading PHPUnit-3.3.17.tgz ...
Starting to download PHPUnit-3.3.17.tgz (272,418 bytes)
..........................................done: 272,418 bytes
install ok: channel://pear.phpunit.de/PHPUnit-3.3.17</pre>

<p>
Tata &#8230; that&#8217;s it. If you want, you can install the optional packages. If want to install all the dependencies add the option &#8212;alldeps to the install command. The output will be like this (quite long - sorry):
</p>
<pre>$ sudo pear install --alldeps phpunit/PHPUnit
WARNING: "pear/DB" is deprecated in favor of "pear/MDB2"

<p>
As you can see it&#8217;s quiet simple to install PHPUnit. The last step is to check wheter everything is good or not by writing a simple test (taken from the manual). Create a new file named StackTest.php and write the following into it:
</p>
<pre>
<?php require_once 'PHPUnit/Framework.php';

class StackTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {
    public function testPushAndPop() {
        $stack = array();
        $this->assertEquals(0, count($stack));

        array_push($stack, 'foo');
        $this-&gt;assertEquals('foo', $stack[count($stack)-1]);
        $this-&gt;assertEquals(1, count($stack));

        $this-&gt;assertEquals('foo', array_pop($stack));
        $this-&gt;assertEquals(0, count($stack));
    }
}
?&gt;</pre>

Now let&#8217;s see if we can use PHPUnit:

<pre>$ phpunit --verbose StackTest
PHPUnit 3.3.17 by Sebastian Bergmann.

StackTest
.

Time: 0 seconds

OK (1 test, 5 assertions)</pre>
<p>
If you see this result, everything works.
</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s it for this time. In the next posts I will write about the integration of unit tests in our software - but don&#8217;t ask me when ;-). Please go and read the manual for PHPUnit in the meantime. Thanks to Sebastian Bergman!
</p>
